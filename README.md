# 👋 Hi, I'm Pedro Paulo Favato Barcelos

**Senior Metadata and Semantics Specialist at [Health-RI](https://www.health-ri.nl/)**

_**Ontology Engineering | Conceptual Modeling | Semantic Web | FAIR Data**_

---

I am an Ontology Engineer with a strong background in **conceptual modeling**, **knowledge graphs**, and **semantic interoperability**. With over a decade of experience across academic, governmental, and industrial projects, I’ve contributed to initiatives in telecommunications, healthcare, supply chains, and transportation.

Currently, I work at **Health-RI**, a Dutch national initiative to advance health research. My focus is on **semantic data integration** and **metadata standards** for clinical and biomedical data.

Throughout my academic (BSc, MSc, PhD) and professional journey, I’ve worked extensively with ontologies—from their **philosophical foundations** to **practical implementations**—using **UFO**, **OntoUML**, and **semantic web technologies** like **RDF**, **OWL**, **SPARQL**, and **SHACL**. I also hold an **MBA in Project Management**. My go-to language for data work and automation is **Python**.
